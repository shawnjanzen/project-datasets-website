        <li>"The Washington Post is compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015. [...] In 2015, The Post began tracking more than a dozen details about each killing — including the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by culling local news reports, law enforcement websites and social media and by monitoring independent databases such as Killed by Police and Fatal Encounters.  [...] only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shot and killed a civilian [...] The FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. In 2015, The Post documented more than two times more fatal shootings by police than had been recorded by the FBI. Last year, the FBI announced plans to overhaul how it tracks fatal police encounters." (Washington Post Github)</li>

        <li>"This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. ... scraped from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018. Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered."  https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home</li>
